- The gallery is still a work in progress so some of the traditional pieces I list are missing photos; however, I am in the process of adding all of them.

## I have a lot of interests outside of the computer screen.
I love to create things, in any form of media. Portrait work with graphite or charcoal, digital art, writing stories, and just about anything you can think of. Well... except maybe pottery and I'm only just getting into crochetting. 

In college I recently rekindled an old love for performance arts. Ever since I was young I've had a love of theater of any kind but I only recently got into really acting on the stage again. I wasn't able to participate in High School theater as I was taking too many AP and concurrent enrollment classes but since readjusting my schedule I've been in many different plays over the years I've been in college: 
- Merry Wives of Windsor (2019)
  - I played Nim and a servant
- Almost Maine (2019)
  - I played Gayle in scene 4
- Incorruptible (2021)
  - I played the Peasant Woman
- The Frogs (2021)
  - I played Jane Austin
- The Mousetrap (2022)
  - I played Mr. Paravicini
- Nell Gywnn (2023)
  - I will be playing Rose Gywnn

<!-- I do have one pet, it's a cat that I call Chiich or Chiichers (I know the name is weird spelled out but it fits her). She's a domestic longhair barnyard cat that's not even a year old yet and I absolutely adore her. I've put a lot of effort into socializing her with other pets (still working on dogs) and people as well as handled her so she's very well behaved and even enjoys being picked up and held. -->

I've also recently gotten into learning a lot of board games and getting better at the card games I already know, like poker (no money involved just fun) and cribbage. 

## And some still on the computer.
I like to play a lot of video games, especially with friends. My favorite single player game might be the Lara Croft series (the new ones from 2013). 

In the coding windows I like working in HTML and the styling languages and I'm also working on small circuitry projects outside of the coding windows. I'm hoping to get further into computer hardware and learning more about how to build things.

I intend to put more effort into learning Python as a backend/circuitry language and C# as a .NET website building tool.
