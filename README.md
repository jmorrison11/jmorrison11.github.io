# Welcome to Jade Morrison's Online Portfolio 
![](pfp.JPG)

## My name is Jade and I'm 22 years old on my way to getting a bachelor's degree in Computer Science by May 2023.
A major in Computer Science and a concentration in software development as well as a minor of art.

### I have a lot of interests outside of the computer screen.
I love to create things, in any form of media. Portrait work with graphite or charcoal, digital art, writing stories, and just about anything you can think of. Well... except maybe pottery and I'm only just getting into crochetting. 

I've also recently gotten into learning a lot of board games and getting better at the card games I already know, like poker (no money involved just fun) and cribbage. 

### And some still on the computer.
I like to play a lot of video games, especially with friends. My favorite single player game might be the Lara Croft series (the new ones from 2013). 

In the coding windows I like working in HTML and the styling languages and I'm also working on small circuitry projects outside of the coding windows. I'm hoping to get further into computer hardware and learning more about how to build things. 

### Since this is an online portfolio I'm sure you're interested in more then just what I like do.
