## I have a lot of interests outside of the computer screen.
I love to create things, in any form of media. Portrait work with graphite or charcoal, digital art, writing stories, and just about anything you can think of. Well... except maybe pottery and I'm only just getting into crochetting. 

I've also recently gotten into learning a lot of board games and getting better at the card games I already know, like poker (no money involved just fun) and cribbage. 

## And some still on the computer.
I like to play a lot of video games, especially with friends. My favorite single player game might be the Lara Croft series (the new ones from 2013). 

In the coding windows I like working in HTML and the styling languages and I'm also working on small circuitry projects outside of the coding windows. I'm hoping to get further into computer hardware and learning more about how to build things.
