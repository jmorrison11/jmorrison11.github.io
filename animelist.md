# Scenebuilder with API List (MyAnimeList)

I built this program using the IDE Netbeans in the language of Java. The GUI was built in the JavaFX program called scenebuilder. 

![Here is what the GUI looked like to give an idea of how the project worked](animelist.png)

- I used an FXML document controller to add functionality to the buttons, list view, and text boxes. 

- It uses an API that is filled with quotes from anime shows, the API is sorted by the title of the anime. Using gson and json I called the API based on the 
name of the anime you would enter into the text box.
