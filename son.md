# Star of the North Maternity Home
## Upgrading and Centralizating their Technological Processes

This was the project in my final capstone course. We were a team of four all working with a community non-profit to upgrade the hardware they had to better suit their
needs as all as streamlining their online appilcation process for residents, volunteers, and employees. I will cover here what I did during the project.

- Website Modernization
  - We took all the information of their old website and created a new more modern website layout from it. 
  - There were a lot of meetings discussing the formatting and layout as well as coloring and changing out old photos. 
  - We also rewired their donation format as well, from stripe to paypal to cut down on costs.
  - We are still currently waiting on the website to move to it's new domain. More information and pictures in the project retrospective.

- Hardware
  - There was a lot to do with hardware and where I was mostly focused to during the project. 
  - I changed the harddrive from a mechcanical one to an SSD in their HP all-in-one resident computer. As well as doing a fresh install of windows on that computer.
  - I added a second monitor to their desktop tower set-up.
  - I helped them add a laptop for the non-managerial staff to use without compromsing the security of what an admmin/manager would use.
    - This involved putting the laptop on a child microsoft account, making staff unable to download unsecure programs or logging into a personal email account. 
  - Created documentation on how to use these devices and what to do if any common issues arose.
  - We did this all within a budget of 1,000 dollars. 

- Security 
  - Added two new users to their desktop setup, erasing the one that was used and compromised. There are now two separate logins for admins and managers.
  - Added a secure password manager to the admin user.
  - Added a profile system in their browser for the manager users.
  - Created documentation on hardware security, giving them all detailed instructions on what to do and how to keep their technology secure.
