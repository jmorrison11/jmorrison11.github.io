# My Senior Art Captsone (Motif)

## Artist Statement
Visual and performance art are never that far away from each other, artists can be heavily influenced by plays and plays influenced by art. 
Musicals and plays have always been inspiring to artists and theater kids with their head in the clouds. 
Condensing a complex narrative into just a singular art piece isn’t easily possible so relying on motifs, macabre scenes, and tragedies make a much more 
compelling art piece. Codifying scenes in plays has been a crux in artists galleries for centuries, used by the Romans in the humanism era of art, using Greek plays 
and myths to give way to heroic or sensual scenery, or other artists translating Shakespeare’s tragic scenes into meaningful art pieces. 
These works are meant to be a more modern take on an old concept, using new forms of medium, such as digital, to recreate motifs and somber moments in musicals 
that are particularly moving.
